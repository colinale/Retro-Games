Falco, a loyal friend of Fox, decided to leave the team in search of new challenges. Peppy, in his old age, quit his duties as a pilot to focus on navigation, and Slippy did likewise, focusing on his technological developments. While Fox and his comrades are recognized as heroes, they've received little in the way of work since Andross's death, and their ship, the Great Fox, has seen much better days. However, one day, as they're approaching Dinosaur Planet at the edge of the Lylat System, they receive a message from General Pepper asking Fox to investigate what's caused the world to suddenly start breaking up and find a way to fix it. At the same time, Dinosaur Planet's inhabitants are under the dictatorial rule of General Scales, whom Fox must contend with in order to complete his mission. And then there's the mysterious Krystal, who became trapped in a large crystal after being attacked within Krazoa Palace. Can Fox free her and receive her help to stop General Scales and save Dinosaur Planet?",
